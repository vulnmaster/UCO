# ICAC Ontology Family - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
Current ICAC data sets are siloed (NCMEC XML, ICCAM CSV). Our ontologies unify these disparate formats into a standardized, interoperable framework for representing and sharing data about child exploitation investigations and hotline operations. This document outlines the requirements for the 23-module ontology family and its supporting technologies. This family of ontologies was assembled using Claude 4 Sonnet to conduct an analysis of law enforcement and prosecutor's press releases that describe the results of investigations and legal process for crimes against children and trafficking. This family of ontologies extend the Unified Cyber Ontology and the Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE) Ontology. This make it possible to model all aspects of an child sexual abuse or child sex trafficking investigation, including the digital forensics examination.

**NEW**: The ontology family now includes comprehensive gUFO (Unified Foundational Ontology) integration, providing enhanced semantic precision, temporal modeling, and validation capabilities for law enforcement investigations.
